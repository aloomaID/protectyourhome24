                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Rankin is a city in Upton County, Texas, United States. Its population was 778 at the 2010 census. It is named after F.E. Rankin, a local rancher. It is the county seat of the thinly populated county; in 2010, only 3,355 people lived in the entire county, and McCamey was the only larger town. During the early 20th century, the town grew due to the discovery of oil in the nearby Yates Oil Field. However, since a second oil boom in the '80s, the town has seen a decline in its economy and population.</p>
